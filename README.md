# Learnbydoing.io

Learn by doing is site for documenting all kinds of programming related learning stuff. The basic idea is to pickup some interesting topic and start learning it by doing as the domain name says :).
I try to document all the commands I use will doing exercises and do commits often as it is somehow wise.

## Environment

Atleast for start everything is done in Arch Linux machine, but I hope that while I get futher in these "exercises" I could have somekind of techlab environment for doing the experiments.
